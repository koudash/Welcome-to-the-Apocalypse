# Is This the Apocalypse?

**Team Members: *Andrea Cicero*, *Elsa Schieffelin*, *Lei Kang*, *Ovais Patoli***

**Proposal:** We know that there have been significantly more natural disasters from 1900 until now. Our group strives to research how this frequency effects economic costs, local population, and housing. We will also map the natural disasters using Leaflet to see if we can see any locational patterns.

We plan to examine United States specific natural disasters over the past 70 years (1950 to 2019). 

**Dataset:**
